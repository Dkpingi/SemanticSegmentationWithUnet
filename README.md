# Semantic Segmentation using a U-Net
This repository performs semantic segmentation on darkfield microscopy images \
based on the dataset:

The model architecture is a U-Net, which is widely used for semantic segmentation \
of images of biological origin, such as microscopes, or medical images.

I was able to reach a validation accuracy of about 80%, but my hardware was restricted
to models of up to 4GB at the time, so it could probably go higher than that.
